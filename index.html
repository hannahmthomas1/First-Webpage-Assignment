      <h2>Better Names</h2>
      <p>Have you ever been on a nice walk or hike in the mountains when a well-meaning friend or family member
        interupts the peaceful silence by deciding to quiz you about local foliage? Well I have. I love plants, but I am
        not going to remember their names. But don't fear! There is a simple solution! We can make this world a better
        place by giving plants better names.</p>

      <h2>The Big Idea</h2>
      <p>This problem <em>does</em> have a solution! That is, to have trees named by people who don't know anything
        about trees.
        That (likely) means you! When you lose something, the best place to put it next time is the first place you
        looked. So, better names for trees are the first words we think of when we see it!</p>

      <h3>For Example:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Pine Tree</strong></dt>
        <dd>Dark Pointy Tree</dd>
        <dt><strong>Oak</strong></dt>
        <dd>Spotted white trunk with round leaves</dd>
        <dt><strong>Redwood</strong></dt>
        <dd>Really Big</dd>
      </dl>

    <h3>Why try?</h3>
    <p>According to globaltrees.org, there are 60,065 tree species. The average adult knows 20,000-35,000 words.
      Even if we tried, we would be unable to remember them all. Is it really worth trying? </p>
